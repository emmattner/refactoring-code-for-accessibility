# refactoring-code-for-accessibility
Applying accessible code to an exisiting website by refacatoring the HTML and CSS

The motivation for this project was to modify a website to become an accessiable site to ensure that people with disabilities can access a website by using assistive technology such as a screen reader.

This was built in hopes not only to become more accessbile for people with disabilites but also to be able to rank higher in search engines such as Google. It also helps to avoid any litigation that may arise from a person with a disability being unable to access this site;
this solves the problem of having an unaccesible site to disabled users. 

I learnt that it is always important for a site to be accessible for people with a disability and to contain alt tags for images to help with assistive technologies such as a screen reader.

My project stands out as I have really taken to the time to do extensive alt tags to really help aid assistive technologies such as a screen reader to leave the disabled user feeling satisfied and able to easily understand what images are being displayed through a text format.
